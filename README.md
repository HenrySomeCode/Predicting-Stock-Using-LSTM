# Predicting Stock Using LSTM

Hi, this project includes:

- A short theory part: 2 pictures used to describe how LSTM works
  
- Part II: coding LSTM from scratch. This part is relatively detailed, but it's only for understanding how to make LSTM in terms of coding.

  This part will not be used in Part III, which is an application that uses LSTM. The reason is that I still need to understand some LSTM formulas in back-propagation fully.

  Besides, the original reference document does not include any application for this LSTM architecture, and my time is limited, so I decided to include another project (Part III) that I have coded a long time before.

- Part III: Predicting Stock using the LSTM model.
